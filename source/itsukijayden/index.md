Greetings to the guest! I’m one of the admins of BSBA. I know that I don’t have a lot of programming experience like my
friends, but to help them I try to come up with ideas and try to support them. Anyway, I know a decent amount of C++. 
I might not know it like a senior but I can handle it. Currently, I’m learning the programming language Python. I’m learning
this to slowly reach my goal to create AI. For now, I’m learning to make a Telegram Bot. I’ve had some experiences with
web-development with HTML. I was also interested in creating games in Unity so I know a little about C#.
Anyway, to make it short I’m almost a Sophomore in programming but I will catch up to rest of the admins and contribute more.
